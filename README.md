# Sound Sets (Local) Plugin

This plugin adds a command that can push a Syrinscape URI to a locally running Syrinscape desktop client ("Genre Player"), not the online player.  This is initially implemented only for Fantasy Player.   This plugin is needed on MacOS, because the custom URI protocol handler for Syrinscape URIs is missing on that platform.  It also works on Windows.

## Next Steps

- Paste handler to auto convert links to commands
